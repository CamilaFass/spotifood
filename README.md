## Built With

- React.JS
- Bootstrap (for styling)
- create-react-app (to start off the app development)
- react-alert-template-basic (alerts for react)
- axios (sends HTTP requests and managing the responses)
- react-dom (compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.)
- react-loader-spinner (provides simple React SVG spinner component which can be implemented for async await operation before data loads to the view.)
- react-redux (Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.)
- react-router-dom (DOM bindings for React Router. react-router-dom is made for "Web application")
